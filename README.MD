## mllib.classification
* The spark.mllib package supports various methods for binary classification, multiclass classification and regression analysis. Some of the most popular algorithms in classification are Random Forest, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, etc.
### classification options
* LinearSVC 
* LogisticRegression
* DecisionTree 
* GBTClassifier
* RandomForest
* NaiveBayes
* MultilayerPreceptronClassifier
* OneVsRest

## mllib.clustering
* Clustering is an unsupervised learning problem, whereby you aim to group subsets of entities with one another based on some notion of similarity.
### clustering options
* BisectingKMeans
* Kmeans
* GaussianMixture
* LDA

## mllib.fpm
* Frequent pattern matching is mining frequent items, itemsets, subsequences or other substructures that are usually among the first steps to analyze a large-scale dataset. This has been an active research topic in data mining for years.
### fpm opttions 
* FPGrowth

## mllib.linalg
* MLlib utilities for linear algebra.

## mllib.recommendation
* Collaborative filtering is commonly used for recommender systems. These techniques aim to fill in the missing entries of a user item association matrix.
### recommendation options
* ALS

## mlib.regression 
* Linear regression belongs to the family of regression algorithms. The goal of regression is to find relationships and dependencies between variables. The interface for working with linear regression models and model summaries is similar to the logistic regression case.
### regression options
* AFTSurvivalRegression
* DecisionTressRegression
* GBTRegression
* GeneralizedLinearRegression
* isotonicRegression
* linearRegression
* RandomForestRegressor
